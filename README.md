This is a very early prototype I've been working on every so often as hobby.

*⚠️ This is a Godot v3.2.3 project ⚠️*

## About

Coucou Jess is an educational game intended for both vocabulary building aimed at French students and cultural diffusion of Francophony.
<br>Players will follow Jess around the French speaking world and help her collect as many words related to each place as they can in order to complete their compendium. Every new word will feature its meaning and relevance in the compendium.

### How it plays

The core mechanic, that is how the player is able to complete their compendium, is very close to a hangman game, but instead of typing in a guess, players will move around each location, jumping and avoiding enemies, and hit letter blocks they think match their guesses.
<br><a target="_blank" href="https://gabrielhamdan.github.io/Coucou-Jess/#game">Here</a> you can check a very simple preview running on JavaScript.

<br>Besides enemies, players will also have to deal with limited time to to complete each word.

### What it looks like so far

  <p><b>Jess won't get hurt by the enemies: her glasses will break instead! 💗</b></p>

  <p><b>You can also buy some time if you're running out of it! ⏳</b></p>

## Why I'm making this game

It's lots fun and it teaches me a lot about coding since I'm just a beginner.
<br>Also, I wanted to make a game to promote my wife's French teaching brand -- so why not make her into the main character of an educational game aimed at French language learners?

### What's next

There's still a lot to do, as you can see -- basically a whole game. I will update this repository whenever I can... Until then, feel free to give me some feedback, it'll be much appreciated.
<br>Thanks for reading all this! 😁
